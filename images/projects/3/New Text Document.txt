Bathymetry of Gwadar, Pakistan – Poster Design

This poster captures the striking underwater topography of Gwadar, a coastal city in southwestern Pakistan known for its deep-sea port and strategic maritime significance. The data used for this visualization was sourced from the Bathymetric Data Viewer by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which provides publicly available and scientifically accurate seabed mapping data. The unique depth contours and underwater features revealed through this bathymetric data served as the foundation for the composition.

To bring the data to life visually, I used Inkscape, an open-source vector graphics editor. The design process involved careful layering, color grading, and stylization to emphasize the depth variations and fluid transitions between land and sea. A special shoutout goes to the creator of a tutorial video that inspired aspects of the visual treatment and layout — their approach helped shape the artistic direction of the final piece. This project not only celebrates the hidden beauty of Earth's underwater landscapes but also demonstrates how scientific data can be transformed into compelling visual art.
